Carry propagation bugs in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications.

GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage."

  repo: https://github.com/apache/cxf-fediz/
  commit: b6ed9865d0614332fa419fe4b6d0fe81bc2e660d:master
  description: "Apache CXF Fediz is vulnerable to DTD based XML attacks This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.4.  description:  Apache CXF Fediz is a subproject of Apache CXF which implements the WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile for SSO specification.  In 2015, a security advisory CVE-2015-5175 was issued for Apache CXF Fediz,  titled \"Apache CXF Fediz application plugins are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks\". This was due to the fact that Document Type Declarations (DTDs) were not disabled when parsing the response from the Identity Provider (IdP).  The fix for advisory CVE-2015-5175 in Apache CXF Fediz 1.1.3 and 1.2.1  prevented DoS style attacks via DTDs. However, it did not fully disable DTDs, meaning that the Fediz plugins could potentially be subject to a DTD-based XML attack.  In addition, the Apache CXF Fediz IdP is also potentially subject to DTD-based XML attacks for some of the WS-Federation request parameters.  This has been fixed in revision:  https://github.com/apache/cxf-fediz/commit/b6ed9865d0614332fa419fe4b6d0fe81bc2e660d  Migration:  Apache CXF Fediz users should upgrade to 1.4.4 as soon as possible."

  description: "Unsafe Unzip with spring-integration-zip. description: spring-integration-zip , versions prior to 1.0.2, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. The previous CVE-2018-1261 prevented the framework itself from writing the file. While the framework itself now does not write such files, it does present the errant path to the user application, which could inadvertently write the file using that path. This specifically applies to the unzip transformer. This can only happen if an application using this library accepts and unpacks zip files from untrusted sources. Affected Pivotal Products and Versions: Spring Integration Zip Community Extension Project versions 1.0.1.RELEASE and earlier. Mitigation: Upgrade to the 1.0.2.RELEASE Or do not unzip untrusted zip files."

  description: "Both Spring Security and the Spring Framework rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional differences."

HttpRequest.scheme now respects SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER, if it is configured, and the appropriate header is set on the request, for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

  description: "openstack-ironic-inspector: SQL Injection vulnerability when receiving introspection data  There is an SQL-injection vulnerability in the inpector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes an SQL query using unescaped data received on the wire from a server reporting inspection results (specifically, via a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint).  The unescaped data should not be trusted - the API is unauthenticated and it's likely that anything with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening could exploit the vulnerability.  Because of how the results of the query are used, there appears to be no way to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data. It could be exploited for destructive ends by passing malicious data (e.g. \"\'; DROP DATABASE;\'\")."

  description: "Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification (see below). Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed."

  description: "JSONP enabled by default in MappingJackson2JsonView. description: Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18, and older unsupported versions, allows web applications to enable cross-domain requests via JSONP (JSON with Padding) through AbstractJsonpResponseBodyAdvice for REST controllers, and MappingJackson2JsonView for browser requests. Both are not enabled by default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot. However when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the jsonp and callback JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests.\nAllowing cross-domain requests from untrusted origins may expose user information to 3rd party browser scripts.\nThis vulnerability applies to applications that:\n - Explicitly configure MappingJackson2JsonView.\n - And do not set the jsonpParameterNames property of MappingJackson2JsonView to an empty set.\n - And expose sensitive user information over endpoints that can render content with JSONP.\n\nAffected Pivotal Products and Versions: Spring Framework 5.0 to 5.0.6. pring Framework 4.1 to 4.3.17. Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:\n- 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.7.\n- 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.18.\n- Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch, or otherwise set MappingJacksonJsonViews jsonpParameterNames property to an empty set.\n\nApplications that do require JSONP support will need to explicitly configure the jsonpParameterNames property of MappingJacksonJsonView following the upgrade. It is recommended that applications switch to using CORS instead of JSONP to enable cross-domain requests. JSONP support in the Spring Framework is deprecated as of 5.0.7 and 4.3.18 and will be removed in 5.1."

  description: "Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)  Overview: org.nd4j:nd4j-common is a Deeplearning4j, ND4J, DataVec and more - deep learning & linear algebra for Java/Scala with GPUs + Spark - From Skymind.  Details: Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA \"Zip Slip\"). It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a \"../../file.exe\" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.  Remediation: A fix was pushed into the master branch but not yet published (2018-10-31)."

  description: "While using kerberos Hadoop incorrectly assumes names with '@' to be non-simple. description: In the scenario of a trust between two directories, eg. FreeIPA (ipa.local) and Active Directory (ad.local) users can be made available on the OS level by something like sssd. The trusted users will be of the form 'user@ad.local' while other users are will not contain the domain. Executing 'id -Gn user@ad.local' will successfully return the groups the user belongs to if configured correctly. However, it is assumed by Hadoop that users of the format with '@' cannot be correct. This code is in KerberosName.java and seems to be a validator if the 'auth_to_local' rules are applied correctly. In my opinion this should be removed or changed to a different kind of check or maybe logged as a warning while still proceeding, as the current behavior limits integration possibilities with other standard tools. Workaround are difficult to apply (by having a rewrite by system tools to for example user_ad_local) due to down stream consequences. Fixed Version/s: 2.8.0, 3.0.0-alpha1, 2.7.6"

  description: "description: Arbitrary File Write Archive Extract. org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-archiver is a Collection of Plexus components to create archives or extract files out of an archive to a directory with a unified Archiver/UnArchiver API whatever the archive format is. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write through Archive Extract. It can be exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a ../../file.exe location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily. Remediation: Upgrade org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-archiverto version 3.6.0 or higher."

  description: "Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. The patch is available at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2883, however the fix for this bug was incomplete. To fix the problem please use the patch at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2905 (the incomplete fix was assigned the new identifier CVE-2014-3596)."

This means that users who cached their CLI authentication before Jenkins was updated to 2.150.2 and newer, or 2.160 and newer, would remain authenticated.  Support for the remoting-based CLI was dropped in Jenkins 2.165, so newer weekly releases are not affected. Jenkins 2.164.2 no longer supports legacy CLI authentication caches from before 2.150.2/2.160, and these users will be considered logged out."

  description: "DoS Attack via Range Requests. Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch provide support for range requests when serving static resources through the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when an annotated controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that overlap, or both, for a denial of service attack.  This vulnerability affects applications that depend on either spring-webmvc or spring-webflux. Such applications must also have a registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource.  Spring Boot applications that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static resources out of the box and are therefore vulnerable.  Affected Pivotal Products and Versions: - Spring Framework 5.1 - Spring Framework 5.0.0 to 5.0.9 - Spring Framework 4.3 to 4.3.19 - Older unsupported versions going back to 4.2 are also affected  Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation. - 5.1 users should upgrade to 5.1.1 - 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.10 - 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.20 - 4.2.x users should upgrade to a supported branch. No further mitigation steps are necessary.  Note the following when evaluating the impact: Support for Range requests was introduced in version 4.2. Therefore versions prior to 4.2 are not affected by this issue. Support for returning an org.springfamework.core.io.Resource from an annotated controller was introduced in 5.0. Therefore versions prior to 5.0 can only be impacted through a registration to serve static resources.  History: 2018-10-16: Initial vulnerability report published."

  commit: 6344867dce6767af7d0fe34fb393271a6456672d:master
  description: "XStream can be used for Remote Code Execution. The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that can execute arbitrary shell commands. All versions until and including version 1.4.6 are affected, but a workaround exist."

  description: "Important: Denial of Service CVE-2019-10072  The fix for CVE-2019-0199 was incomplete and did not address HTTP/2 connection window exhaustion on write. By not sending WINDOW_UPDATE messages for the connection window (stream 0) clients were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.  This was fixed with commits 7f748eb, ada725a, 0bcd69c and 8d14c6f.  This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by John Simpson of Trend Micro Security Research working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative on 26 April 2019.

  description: "There exists a Java Object in the Apache Commons FileUpload library that can be manipulated in such a way that when it is deserialized, it can write or copy files to disk in arbitrary locations. Furthermore, while the Object can be used alone, this new vector can be integrated with ysoserial to upload and execute binaries in a single deserialization call. This may or may not work depending on an application's implementation of the FileUpload library."

  description: "NIFI-4436: Fixed bug that causes a deadlock when changing version of a PG. Before this patch, an update would obtain a write lock and then recurse downward through the child groups, obtaining write locks to update variable registries. At the same time, if a Processor is obtaining a Controller Service, it will obtain a Read Lock on the Process Group and then recurse upward through the ancestors, obtaining Read Lock. If the timing is right, we can have a group obtain a read lock, then try to obtain its parent's Read Lock. At the same time, an update to the group could hold the Write Lock on the Process Group and attempt to obtain a Write Lock on child (where the Processor lives), resulting in a deadlock. Remediation: Upgrade org.apache.nifi:nifi-framework-core to version 1.5.0 or higher."

  description: "Both Spring Security and the Spring Framework rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional differences."

  description: "org.apache.axis2:axis2 is a Web Services / SOAP / WSDL engine, the successor to Apache Axis SOAP stack. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters like < > \" ' must escaped properly. Otherwise, an attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code. This may lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value entered into the template. BUG: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - ListingAgent.java. Remediation: Upgrade axis2 to version 1.7.4 or higher."

A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the \"redirect_uri\" parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code.  This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements:  Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. @EnableAuthorizationServer) Uses the DefaultRedirectResolver in the AuthorizationEndpoint This vulnerability does not expose applications that:  Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different RedirectResolver implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver Act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer) Act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient)  Affected Pivotal Products and Versions Severity is critical unless otherwise noted.

For users of Spring Boot 1.5.x and Spring IO Platform Cairo, it is highly recommended to override the spring-security-oauth version to the latest version containing the patch for the CVE. In order to override the version, you need to declare/set the property spring-security-oauth.version.  Below are instructions for users of Spring Boot 1.5.x.  To override a property using Maven, declare the property in your pom’s <properties> section:  <properties>  <spring-security-oauth.version>2.0.17.RELEASE</spring-security-oauth.version> </properties>  To override a property using Gradle, configure the value in your build.gradle script:  ext['spring-security-oauth.version'] = '2.0.17.RELEASE'  Or in gradle.properties:  spring-security-oauth.version=2.0.17.RELEASE  NOTE: The same instructions apply for users of Spring IO Platform Cairo. However, the version to specify is 2.2.4.RELEASE"

  description: "Missing permission check allowed connecting to RabbitMQ in Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin   SECURITY-970  A missing permission check in a form validation method of Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins initiate a RabbitMQ connection to an attacker-specified host and port with an attacker-specified username and password.  Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  description: "description: The Spring RabbitMQ Java Client does not perform hostname validation. This means that SSL certificates of other hosts are blindly accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the Spring RabbitMQ Java Client and an RabbitMQ server it's connecting to. TLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client. Spring AMQP uses the RabbitMQ amqp-client java library for communication with RabbitMQ. It uses the RabbitConnectionFactoryBean to create/configure the connection factory.\n Affected Versions: \n - Spring-AMQP versions prior to 1.7.10 and 2.0.6 /n - RabbitMQ amqp-client versions prior to 4.8.0 and 5.4.0 .\n Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: \n - Upgrade to the 1.7.10.RELEASE or 2.0.6.RELEASE and set the enableHostnameValidation property to true. Override the transitive amqp-client version to at least 4.8.0 and 5.4.0, respectively. \n - The upcoming 2.1.0.RELEASE will set the property to true by default.\n - If you are using the amqp-client library directly to create a connection factory, refer to its javadocs for the enableHostnameValidation() method."

  description: "Cross Site Tracing (XST) with Spring Framework. description: Spring Framework (versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18, and older unsupported versions) allow web applications to change the HTTP request method to any HTTP method (including TRACE) using the HiddenHttpMethodFilter in Spring MVC. If an application has a pre-existing XSS vulnerability, a malicious user (or attacker) can use this filter to escalate to an XST (Cross Site Tracing) attack. Affected Pivotal Products and Versions: Spring Framework 5.0 to 5.0.6, Spring Framework 4.3 to 4.3.17, Older unsupported versions are also affected. Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: \n- 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.7. \n- 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.18. \n- Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch. \nThere are no other mitigation steps necessary. This attack applies to applications that: \n1/ Use the HiddenHttpMethodFilter (it is enabled by default in Spring Boot). \n2/ Allow HTTP TRACE requests to be handled by the application server. \nThis attack is not exploitable directly because an attacker would have to make a cross-domain request via HTTP POST, which is forbidden by the Same Origin Policy. This is why a pre-existing XSS (Cross Site Scripting) vulnerability in the web application itself is necessary to enable an escalation to XST."
